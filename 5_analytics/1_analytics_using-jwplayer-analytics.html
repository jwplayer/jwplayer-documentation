<p>Your JW Player Dashboard comes complete with an analytics section, where you can monitor your content performance and look at activity by device, geography, engagement, and more. </p>
<p>If you use the dashboard's publish mode to build embed code, your information will appear automatically. If you are using a more custom embedding method, be sure to follow our <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1406723-embedding">embedding</a> instructions to make sure that your analytics information is accurate.</p>

<h2>Analytics in the Dashboard</h2>
<p>Our design allows you to easily see overall metrics for your account, content-level data (each piece of content is defined by unique media-id), and domain level data (only top-level domains are currently reported). &nbsp;You can also see these metrics split by device and geography.</p>
<p>It is also possible to download this information via CSV, or access it via API.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the way that we track analytics from within the player, it is not possible to keep count of time watched and engagement for live streams. Please keep this in mind when looking to track certain aspects of playback.</p>
