<p>Looking for the API key and secret for your JW Player account? Here are the instructions to find them in your account dashboard:
<ol>
<li>Log into your <a href="https://account.jwplayer.com">JW Player dashboard</a></li>
<li>Click on the Account menu in the top right corner</li>
<li>Choose Properties from the Account menu (only Admin users will be able to see Properties from this menu, see <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2284233-managing-users"> Managing Users</a> for more details)<br /><br />

<li>
Each property on your account will have a unique API key and secret, so you need to choose the property you want by clicking on the blue property name link or the gear button (see the green arrows below)
<br /><br />

<li>The API key and secret are displayed on the property&#39;s details page. Do not share these details with anyone that you do not want to have direct access to all of your players and videos.<br /><br />
