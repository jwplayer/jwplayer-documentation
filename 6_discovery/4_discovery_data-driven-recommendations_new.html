<p>With Data-Driven Recommendations JW Platform tracks audience interaction, video performance, and content themes across all of your published video library to provide viewers with other videos they'll likely enjoy.</p>
<p>Our system's deeper contextual analysis means that the videos suggested to your viewers by the Data-Driven Recommendations product will  be even more engaging and require much less effort than a human-curated playlist.</p>
<p>Data-Driven Recommendations update dynamically based on current viewer activity. We are always improving our underlying algorithms to drive the deepest engagement possible among your viewers.</p>
<h2>How do Data-Driven Recommendations work?</h2>
<p>Publishers using Data-Driven Recommendations can provide viewers with recommended content in several ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Related Videos Overlay:</strong> If you are using <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1406723-basic-video-embedding-options#1-single-line">single-line embeds</a> (Cloud-Hosted Player + JW Platform content), you can easily turn on the <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1483102-related-videos">related videos overlay</a> to begin displaying recommended content in any JW7 player.&nbsp;See below for the quick start guide.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Driven Feeds: </strong>If you want to provide recommended content through a mobile app, OTT app, or page widget &mdash; or, access Data-Driven recommendations via the API:
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1481963-building-managing-playlists">Trending Playlist</a></li>
		<li>Create a <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2383600-building-managing-data-driven-feeds">Feed</a> &mdash; <strong>Note</strong>: feeds require a &lsquo;source&rsquo; or input media id.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Start Using Data-Driven Recommendations via the Player Builder</h2>

<p><strong>You can turn on Data-Driven Recommendations when building a player if:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>You're a customer who has Data-Driven Recommendations enabled. (If you don't and would like to, <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us">contact us</a>!)</li>
	<li>Your account does&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;use&nbsp;<a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1433647" target="_blank">URL signing</a></li>
	<li>You embed players via the dashboard-provided single-line <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1406723" target="_blank">embed code</a></li>
	<li>The player in question is a&nbsp;<a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403726" target="_blank">JW7</a>&nbsp;player</li>
</ul>

<p>Sign in to the dashboard and navigate to a new or existing player. If your account fits the criteria listed above, you will see the "Related" configuration panel in the player detail page.</p>

<p>Go ahead&mdash;turn it on! To get the biggest boost in plays, enable &quot;autoplay&quot; (shown here).<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/discovery/related-overlay-crop.png" style="width: 300px; height: auto; " />&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">After turning on recommendations, you will see a boost in plays from viewers who want to watch more content inline in the player.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0046;"><strong>Important note:</strong></span> In some cases, it can take up to two hours for our recommended content to appear in your player. (You may preview the related videos overlay immediately, but the quality of data-driven recommendations will greatly improve after the system has processed all your video content).</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What else should I know?</h3>

<p>There are some important things to keep in mind about beta recommendations:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The recommender system works best with English language content, or more specifically English language metadata within the title and description fields.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Some recommendations shown to users will take into consideration all videos and domains within an account. Therefore when some recommendations are displayed videos shown to the user might not be restricted to the domain on which they were initially published. This means that highly relevant videos from one of your domains might be recommended to viewers on another one of your domains.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Using recommendations with content signing turned on is not supported at this time. Turning on content signing after activating the related feature could cause unexpected behavior &mdash; though this should not affect the end viewer&rsquo;s experience.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
