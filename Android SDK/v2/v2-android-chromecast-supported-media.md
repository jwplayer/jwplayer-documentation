The JW Player SDK for Android v2 is available only to customers with an Enterprise license. JW Player plans to deprecate support for this version of the SDK for Android soon. To ensure that your viewers benefit from ongoing SDK improvements, upgrade to [JW Player SDK for Android v3](https://developer.jwplayer.com/sdk/android/docs/developer-guide/index.html). Please contact your JW Player representative if you have additional questions.

Since we are currently using Google's Default Media Receiver, we do not support all media formats when casting.

You can find the supported media formats of the Default Media Receiver [here](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media).
