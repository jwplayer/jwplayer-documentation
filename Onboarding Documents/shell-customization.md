## Player

Dotfiles are a great way to gain efficiencies for repeated tasks. The player team uses [YADR](http://skwp.github.io/dotfiles/).

YADR comes pre-packaged with:

* HomeBrew - OSX package management
* ZSH - an alternative for bash. (Note: switching back to bash is easy: `exec bash`)
* RubyGems

YADR also has customizations/shortcuts for:

* Github
* VIM
* Rails & Ruby
