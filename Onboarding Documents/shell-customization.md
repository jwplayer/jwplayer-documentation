# Customizing Your Terminal

If your team isn't in the list below, update this doc.


## Player

1. Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/). 
2. Install [YADR](http://skwp.github.io/dotfiles/) - the one dotfile to rule them all. YADR comes with zsh - an alternative for bash. (Note: Some commands may not work because of custom ZSH commands. Switching back to bash is easy: `exec bash`). YADR also has customizations/shortcuts for:
	* Github
	* VIM
	* Rails & Ruby
3. Install ffmpeg:
`
brew install ffmpeg --with-libass --with-libvorbis --with-theora --with-tools --without-xvid --with-openjpeg --with-x265 --with-webp --with-libvpx
`
