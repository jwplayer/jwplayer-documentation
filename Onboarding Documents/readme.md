# Onboarding Program

This is a weekly check-in between an experienced JW'er and a junior one. It spans the first month after hiring.

## Goals
 * Efficiently ramp-up new hires
 * Senior is cross-team from junior
 * Junior updates resources as they go through them
 * Lunch at least once


## Timeline
The first Wednesday of each month begins a new session. We will have a meeting with the onboarding seniors to assign them a junior and explain the program. The last Friday of the month ends the program and we will have a retro to discuss how it went.
