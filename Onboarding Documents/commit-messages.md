# Commit Messages

Commit messages should briefly describe the work done and include the ticket number.

In cases where significant changes are made, it's helpful to explain what was done in more detail. 

There will be subtle differences in the style of commit message across the organization. By looking at past commit messages for merged PRs, you'll get a better idea of the expectations of your team.
