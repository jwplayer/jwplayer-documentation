Also, note that all Events below are using the on listener, however it is also possible to register or remove each event with on, once, or off. The use of trigger may also be used for custom events. For an introduction to JW7's API, see the [JavaScript API Quick Start](/api/javascript_api_introduction/).

Happy coding!

## <a name="setup"></a>Setup

These API calls are used to create players and provide setup information. Both setup() and remove() fall under Miscellaneous due to the fact that they are not actually setting, but are rather building and removing players.

###jwplayer( _div_ ).setup( _options_ )
Creates a new JW Player on your web page.

|Attribute(s)|Description|Type| Required|
|--|--------|---|--|
|div| The target div that JW Player will replace | String |Yes|
|options| Configuration options that will tell your player how to render itself | JSON |Yes|

 The only required option when setting up a JW Player embed is the __file__ property. See the [Configuration Options Reference](/customization/configuration-reference/) for a full list of all JW Player configuration options.
####Sample
```
<div id="myDiv">This text will be replaced with a player.</div>
<script>
jwplayer("myDiv").setup({
	"file": "http://example.com/myVideo.mp4",
	"image": "http://example.com/myImage.png",
	"height": 360,
	"width": 640
});
</script>
```


###jwplayer().remove()

Being the reverse of the setup() call, this call will remove a JW Player from the page. It ensures the player stops playback, the DOM is re-set to its original state and all event listeners and timers are cleaned up. Any event listeners will need to be reinstantiated if another player is set up.

###jwplayer().getProvider()

Returns the provider being utilized by JW Player for a particular media file. This replaces JW6's getRenderingMode(), as JW7 will always technically render in html5 mode, even if it is using a flash-based provider.

####Returns an object with the following:

|Value|Description|Type|
|----|--------|---|
|name | The name of the provider currently being used|String|

####List of possible providers:
|Values|Description|
|----|--------|
|flash_video |Static video file with our Flash provider|
|flash_rtmp |Streaming media, utilizing Adobe's RTMP protocol|
|flash_adaptive |Streaming HLS using Adobe Flash|
|flash_sound |Static audio file with Flash provider|
|html5 |Displays whenever content renders natively within a video tag|
|shaka <sup>7.0+</sup>|MPEG Dash Provider|
|caterpillar <sup>7.4+</sup> |HLS content rendering with HLS HTML5 provider|

###jwplayer().getContainer()

Returns the entire HTML of the div in which a JW Player instance exists. This includes all IDs, styles, classes, and content.

###jwplayer().getPlugin()

Targets a particular plugin for API calls. Currently functions with our [Sharing](#sharing) and [Related](#related) plugins.

* * *

###jwplayer().on('ready')

Signifies when the player has been initialized in either Flash or HTML5 and is ready for playback. This is the earliest point at which any API calls should be made.

####Returns an object with the following:

|Value|Description|Type|
|----|--------|---|
|setupTime | The amount of time (in milliseconds) for the player to go from setup() to ready.|Number|


###jwplayer().on('setupError')

####Returns an object with the following:

|Value|Description|Type|
|----|--------|---|

    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
</table>

* * *


## <a name="all"></a>All

###jwplayer().on('all')

This singular API call can be used to gather all events from the player's API. 
####Note: This will output a large amount of information and may degrade browser performance if it is used for an extended period of time.

* * *

## <a name="playlist"></a>Playlist

These API calls are used for loading and retrieving the current playlist (of one or more items), as well as for navigating between playlist items. When accessed via the API, a playlist is an Array, containing one or more objects. Each of these objects contains the following:

## <a name="advertising"></a>Advertising

!!!important
Video ad insertion requires a JW Player Platinum or Enterprise license. Please [contact our team](https://www.jwplayer.com/get-started/) to upgrade your account.
!!!

This API provides developers with more control over the functionality of the Advertising edition of JW Player. For VAST and IMA plugins, this API allows for things like impression verification, custom scheduling, and multiple companions.

###jwplayer().playAd(_tag_)

Used to play an ad immediately, which is primarily useful for situations where the built-in ad schedule of JW Player cannot be used.(e.g. for live streaming or dynamic ads for playlist items)

|Attribute|Description|Type|Required|
|----|--------|---|--|
|tag|The VAST tag URL that should be loaded into the player.|String|Yes|


We recommend to call playAd() in one of these following situations:

1.  inside a JW Player event handler for beforePlay(), to trigger a pre-roll.
2.  inside a JW Player event handler for onTime(), to trigger a mid-roll.
3.  inside a event handler for onBeforeComplete(), to trigger a post-roll.
4.  Outside of event handlers, only when the player is in the playing state.

####Note: As of JW Player 7.0.0, playAd() supports waterfalling via arrays of different ad tags. This will only work when our VAST client is utilized.

* * *

###jwplayer().on('adBlock') <sup>JW 7.3+</sup>

 This event is fired when an ad plugin (Either VAST or Google IMA) is configured inside of the JW Player setup, and an ad blocker is detected on a viewer's browser. It is then possible to request a user disable their ad blocker to proceed.

    <td>-</td>

###jwplayer().on('beforePlay')

Fired just before the player begins playing. Unlike the onPlay event, the player will not have begun playing or buffering when triggered, which makes this the right moment to insert preroll ads using playAd().

    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
</table>


###jwplayer().on('beforeComplete')
