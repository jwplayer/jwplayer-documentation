#Introduction
Hello World! 

We’re JW Player. We strive to enable developers and designers (like you!) to build, customize, and deliver the best video experiences for viewers across web, mobile, and OTT devices. 

##Purpose
Our goal is to provide you with documentation on more advanced uses of JW Player. Here you will find a consolidated reference of API calls and design resources to accelerate your development process with our player.

##Intended Audience
This site specifically caters to developers and designers who are using JW Player in their projects. For basic configuration settings or assistance embedding a player, please see our [support site](https://support.jwplayer.com). If you are visiting the developer site, a basic level of Javascript is required to use our API and a knowledge of CSS is necessary in order to customize our skinning model.

##Licenses
Certain features of JW Player may require specific license types. For example, HLS and DASH streaming requires a Premium license, DRM and Advertising require an Enterprise license. A more extensive explanation of license types, and their features, can be be found on our [pricing page](https://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/).

##Structure
Our developer guide offers sections dedicated to developing with JW Player. Namely, we offer sections like:

* Javascript API
* Customization
* Design Resources
* Release Notes

Within each of these sections, you'll find starter guides, documentation, code samples, links to demos, and additional resources.
