## Introduction

JW Player contains a large number of features and options that can be configured inside of the player setup.  Some options, like **width** or **mute**, are directly placed into the setup. Other, more advanced options, are grouped into nested blocks, like **skin** or **advertising**.

Here is an example setup that contains both **setup** options and specific **advertising** options:

```
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
  "file": "http://example.com/myVideo.mp4",
  "height": 360,
  "width": 640,
  "autostart": true,
  "advertising": {
		"client": "vast",
		"tag": "http://adserver.com/vastTag.xml"
	}
});
```
Web developers will recognize the JavaScript Object Notation ([JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)) syntax of these setup blocks. While configuring player setups, beware of common JSON requirements, like the need for a comma after all but the last element in a list.

<a name="setup"></a>
* * *

## Setup Options

These are the options for configuring the layout and playback behavior of a player. Each is placed directly into the **setup** of the player



The following properties are related to media that is loaded into the player.

If only a single playlist item is used, this information can either be configured directly inside of **setup**. If you are planning on using multiple media items, these can also be used inside of a **[playlist](#playlist)** array.

###Media

<a name="playlist"></a>
* * *

## Playlist

The playlist is a powerful feature of JW Player, used to play multiple video or audio files.

A playlist can be either a **string**, referring to the URL of an RSS feed or JSON file, or an **array** of media objects.

####Configuring Playlist as a String
```
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
  "playlist": "http://example.com/myPlaylist.json"
});
```

####Configuring Playlist as an Array
```
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
    "playlist": [{
        "file": "/assets/sintel.mp4",
        "image": "/assets/sintel.jpg",
        "title": "Sintel Trailer",
        "mediaid": "ddra573"
    },{
        "file": "/assets/bigbuckbunny.mp4",
        "image": "/assets/bigbuckbunny.jpg",
        "title": "Big Buck Bunny Trailer",
        "mediaid": "ddrx3v2"
    }]
});
```

|Setting|Type|Description|
|--|--|--|
|**playlist[_index_].file**|String|**(Required)** If no file is specified in your setup or sources, this is a required configuration option|
|**playlist[_index_].withCredentials**<sup>7.5+</sup>|Boolean|If true, "withCredentials" will be used to request a media file rather than CORS|false|
|**playlist[_index_].title**|String|Title of the item. This is displayed inside of the player prior to playback, as well as in the visual playlist. This can be hidden with the displaytitle option|
|**playlist[_index_].description**|String|Short description of the item. It is displayed below the title. This can be hidden with the displaydescription option.|
|**playlist[_index_].mediaid**|String|Unique identifier of this item. Used by advertising, analytics and discovery services|
|**playlist[_index_].image**|String|Poster image URL. Displayed before and after playback.|
|[playlist&#91;_index_&#93;.sources&#91;&#93;](#playlist-sources) |Array|Used for quality toggling and alternate sources|
|[playlist&#91;_index_&#93;.tracks&#91;&#93;](#playlist-tracks) |Array|Include **captions**, **chapters**, and **thumbnails** for media|
|[playlist&#91;_index_&#93;.adschedule](#playlist-adschedule)|Object|Schedule advertising for a specific media file|

In addition to standard media information, ("title", "description", "mediaid") it is also possible to insert additional metadata, using custom properties. This information **must** be entered inside of a playlist, and cannot be set directly inside of a setup block.

<a name="playlist-sources"></a>

<br/>

### playlist[_index_].sources[]

Sources are inserted into playlist objects and are lists of files. Sources serve a dual purpose, depending on the files used: 

 * **Use different file types:** Alternate "fallback" media sources
 * **Use the same file type:** Toggle quality with static video files

####Alternate Media Sources
If using different file types, sources prioritizes which file to play, based on order. For example, the player will attempt to play myVideo.m3u8 as a first choice. In the event that a browser cannot play an m3u8, the player is intelligent enough to choose myVideo.mp4 instead. In the event that an mp4 cannot be played, the player will attempt the webm format before producing an error.

```
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
  "playlist": [{
    "title":"One Playlist Item With Multiple Sources",
    "description":"Three Sources - One Playlist Item",
    "image": "myImage.png",
    "mediaid": "ddrx3v2",
    "sources": [{
      "file": "myVideo.m3u8"
    },{
      "file": "myVideo.mp4"
    },{
      "file": "myVideo.webm"
    }]
  }]
});
```

####Quality Toggle for Video Files

In the event that a streaming technology like HLS or DASH cannot be used, listing video files of different qualities will enable a quality selection menu in the player control bar. Compared to other streaming methods, it has the following drawbacks:

* No automatic switching, based on bandwidth or download speed
* Changing qualities may cause playback stuttering
* [Pseudostreaming](https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1430518-pseudo-streaming-in-flash) may need to be configured in cases where Flash is used

```
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
  "playlist": [{
    "title":"One Playlist Item With Multiple Qualities",
    "description":"Two Qualities - One Playlist Item",
    "sources": [{
      "file": "myVideo-720p.mp4",
      "label": "HD"
    },{
    "file": "myVideo-480p.mp4",
    "label": "SD"
    }]
  }]
});
```

In the above example, the player will add an "HD" button, allowing a user to toggle their desired video quality. If more than two sources are used, the player will instead overlay a quality selection menu, rather than a quality toggle.

|Config|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**playlist[_index_].sources[].file**|String|URL to the video file, audio file, YouTube video or live stream of this playlist item source.|
|**playlist[_index_].sources[].label**|String|Label of the media source, displayed in the manual HD selection menu. Set this if you have more than 2 qualities of your video.|
|**playlist[_index_].sources[].type**|String|Forces a media type. Only required when a file extension is missing or not recognized (Using .php or certain tokens, for example|
|**playlist[_index_].sources[].default**|Boolean|Set this to **true** for the media source you want to play on startup. If this isn't set for any source, the first one is used|

<a name="playlist-tracks"></a>
<br/>

### playlist[_index_].tracks[]

Tracks can be attached to media for three possible reasons: **captions**, **thumbnails**, or **chapters**. Thumbnail and chapter files **must** be in WEBVTT format. Captions accept **WEBVTT**, **SRT**, and **DFXP** format, though JW Player strongly suggests using **WEBVTT** if possible.

|Config|Type|Description|Default|
|---|---|---|---|
|**playlist[_index_].tracks[].file**|String|URL to the captions, chapters or thumbnails text track file. See [Adding Closed Captions](https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1407438-adding-closed-captions) for an example setup.|-|
|**playlist[_index_].tracks[].kind**|String|The kind of text track. <br/> **"captions":** Captions that display during video playback<br/>**"chapters":** Places markers on the video control bar, displaying different sections<br/>**"thumbnails":** A list of thumbnails that appear when the mouse cursor hovers on the control bar|"captions"|
|**playlist[_index_].tracks[].label**|String|Label of the text track. Is only used in setups with multiple captions, where the label is displayed in the CC selection menu.|index|
|**playlist[_index_].tracks[].default**|Boolean|Only for **captions**. Set this to **true** if you want a captions track to display by default|-|


When using the playlist to load an RSS feed, these options are set in the feed. See the [Media Formats Reference](https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403635-media-format-reference) for an mapping of all playlist options to RSS format.

Use this option to load an entire advertising schedule to JW Player, containing multiple ad breaks. The option can be a URL to a VMAP schedule or an inline JSON block with ads. This schedule will then be applied to each playlist item. For scheduling ads for individual playlist items, see [scheduling ads for playlist items](#playlist-adschedule)

<br/>

####Ad Schedules with VMAP Files
If you are planning on using a VMAP file, simply link to a VMAP .xml file within the advertising block.
```
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
  "file": "http://example.com/myVideo.mp4",
  "advertising": {
    "client": "vast",
    "schedule": "myvmap.xml"
  }
});
```

The VMAP schedule will then be applied to each playlist item. See our article about VMAP schedules for more information.

<br/>

####Embedded Ad Schedules with JSON
In order to use a JSON-formatted schedule, you'll need at least one **ad break** configured inside of an **advertising** block. Each ad break is required to have a unique name, and should include a tag and offset.
