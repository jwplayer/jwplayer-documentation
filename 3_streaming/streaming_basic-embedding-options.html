-->
<p>A big part of JW Player's power lies in its flexibility. Depending on  your needs, there are several different ways to put JW Player on a webpage.</p> 
<p>The process of pairing a JW Player with a piece of content using code and placing that code into a webpage is called "embedding". The block of code itself is called an "embed".</p>
<p>For more programmatic ways of embedding, please visit our <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/docs/developer-guide/embed_players/">API Documentation</a> on this topic.</p>
<div class="panel" style="text-align:center; padding:25px;">
<p>No matter the method, a JW Player embed will end up looking something like this&mdash; <br/> a video playing on a webpage:</p>
<p>
<div id="myElement" style="margin:auto; align-content:center;"></div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("myElement");
playerInstance.setup({
  file: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/HkauGhRi-640.mp4",
  image: "//content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/HkauGhRi-640.jpg",
  width: "100%",
  aspectratio: "16:9",
  title: 'A Basic Video Embed',
  description: 'A video with a basic title and description!'
});
</script>
</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The above embed example uses a video in <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403635-media-format-reference">MP4 format</a>. We highly recommend avoiding using Flash (FLV) content, as FLV does not play on mobile devices or without a Flash <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#Availability" target="_blank">installation</a>. </em></p>

<h3>Selecting an Embedding Method</h3>
<p>Your embedding method will be determined by the place your <strong>Players</strong> and <strong>Content</strong> are hosted (i.e. what systems are responsible for delivery).</p>
<p>Possible options for both Player &amp; Content hosting are: 
<ul>
<li>Hosted by JW Player/JW Platform</li>
<li>Hosted elsewhere (externally)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>For example, area <strong>3</strong> at right represents an embed method for someone self-hosting their JW Player, but serving content that is hosted on JW Platform.</p>

<h2>JW Player (Cloud) + JW Platform</h2>
<p>When using the JW Player Cloud Player with content hosted on JW Platform, you can embed via the <a href="#1-single-line">single-line embed</a> (easiest!) or via a more <a href="#1-custom">custom setup</a>. </p>
<a name="1-single-line"></a>
<h3>Single-Line Embed</h3>
<p><em>This embedding method is great for individual publishers who might grab the single-line embed code from the <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2160275-introduction-to-the-jw-player-dashboard#publish-mode">dashboard</a>, as well as for developers or enterprise customers, who may use our <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/urls/players.html">API</a> to build it.</em></p>
<p>The <strong>single-line embed</strong> is the simplest way to use JW Player. It references <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1469776#adding-content">content you've added</a> to your JW Player account and <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2160275-introduction-to-the-jw-player-dash#players">players you've built</a> or customized. </p>
<p>The embed code itself looks like this:</p>

<div style="padding-left:20px; border-left:2px solid #aab4c8; margin-left:5px;">
<pre>
&lt;script src="//content.jwplatform.com/players/MEDIAID-PLAYERID.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p><em>MEDIAID is replaced with your content's Media ID, and PLAYERID is replaced with the ID of the cloud player being referenced.</em></p>
</div>
<p>This simple embed code contains everything needed for your player and content to display.</p>
<p>Paste the code into the &lt;body&gt; of your page where you want the player to appear. (If you are editing a webpage with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" target="_blank">WYSIWYG</a> editor, be sure to switch to &lt;source&gt; view before pasting).</p>
<p>Because this embed references a JW Player Cloud-Hosted Player, the embedded player can be changed any time (from the <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2160275-introduction-to-the-jw-player-dash#players">dashboard</a> or via the <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/players/index.html">API</a>), and those changes will be reflected live &mdash; no embed code editing required!</p>
<a name="1-custom"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Custom Embed</h3>
<p><em>It is also possible to use more customized embeds within this hosting setup. (For example: you might like to use our dynamically-updatable cloud players along with instance-specific overrides).</em></p>
<p><strong>PART 1:<br/>Add the Player Library URL (JavaScript) to Your Website's &lt;head&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Get the Player Library URL from any player in your JW Player account&mdash; it is accessible via <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2376965-license-keys-downloads#cloud-player-library-URL">dashboard</a> or <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/players/index.html">API</a>.</p>
<p>A Cloud Player Library URL contains all necessary JW Player library JavaScript, PLUS the configuration settings for a specific player from your JW Player account. Adding the Cloud Player Library URL to your site's &lt;head&gt; gives your entire website a JW Player to use with default settings that can be overriden within specific embeds. </p>
<p>The player library URL looks like this:</p>
<div style="padding-left:20px; border-left:2px solid #aab4c8; margin:0px 0px 25px 5px;">
<pre>//content.jwplatform.com/libraries/PLAYERID.js
</pre>
<p><em>PLAYERID is replaced with the ID of the cloud player being referenced.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Place this URL inside a &lt;script&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; of your website. It will look like this:</p>
<div style="padding-left:20px; border-left:2px solid #aab4c8; margin:0px 0px 25px 5px;">
<pre>&lt;script src="//content.jwplatform.com/libraries/PLAYERID.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>When embedding with a player's Library URL, changes made to that player via the <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2160275-introduction-to-the-jw-player-dash#players">dashboard</a> or the <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/players/index.html">API</a> will propagate live without any code updates needed on your website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PART 2:<br/>Write Your Embed Code for the Page &lt;body&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Once the Cloud Player Library is placed in your website's &lt;head&gt; code, you'll need an embed block in-place on the page where you'd like your player + content to appear.</p> 
<p>Below is an example of the minimum required configuration options:</p>
<div style="padding-left:20px; border-left:2px solid #aab4c8; margin:0px 0px 25px 5px;">
<pre>&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/JavaScript&quot;&gt;
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
    file: &quot;//content.jwplatform.com/videos/MEDIAID-sourcekey.mp4&quot;,
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>Here, "<strong>file</strong>" is required. You can find the content URL in the dashboard under Content &gt; Content Detail &gt; Sources Tab, or via the <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/videos/list.html">API</a>.</p>

<p>In this embed block in the &lt;body&gt; of your page, you can set overrides on any of the configuration settings that may or may not already be in the Cloud Player Library URL in the &lt;head&gt; of your site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>JW Player (Self-Hosted) + JW Platform</h2>
<a name="1-single-line"></a>
<h3>Single-Line Embed</h3>
<p>The single-line embed is <strong>not</strong> available for users self-hosting the JW Player JavaScript library.</p>
<a name="2-custom"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Custom Embed</h3>
<p><em>This embedding method is great for users who want to host their own player, but take advantage of JW Platform <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2383915-hosting-storage-streaming-and-jw-platform">services</a>.</em></p>

<p>Prior to embedding with a self-hosted JW Player, you'll need to take a few steps:
<ol>
<li>Download the player from your JW Player dashboard at <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/downloads">Players &gt; License Keys &amp; Downloads</a>.</li>
<li>Get your License Key from that same page</li>
<li>Set up your copy of <strong>jwplayer.js</strong> on your own server, and get its URL</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><strong>PART 1:<br/>Add your hosted JW Player Library  (JavaScript) to Your Website's &lt;head&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Set up the code snippet that needs to be placed in the &lt;head&gt; of your website. It looks like this:</p>
<div style="padding-left:20px; border-left:2px solid #aab4c8; margin:0px 0px 25px 5px;">
<pre>
&lt;script src="//mywebsite.com/jwplayer/jwplayer.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;jwplayer.key="ABCdeFG123456SeVenABCdeFG123456SeVen==;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p><em>The source URL and license key shown above are samples. </em></p>
</div>

<p>Replace the sample information above with your own information, and paste the code snippet into your website's &lt;head&gt;.</p>
<p>The <strong>jwplayer.js</strong> file you host on your ownservers contains all necessary JW Player Library JavaScript. It does not contain configuration settings &mdash; those must be set on the embed level (see Part 2, below). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PART 2:<br/>Write Your Embed Code for the Page &lt;body&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Once the <strong>jwplayer.js</strong> is placed in your website's &lt;head&gt; code, you'll need an embed block in-place on the page where you'd like your player + content to appear.</p>

&lt;script type=&quot;text/JavaScript&quot;&gt;
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
    file: &quot;//content.jwplatform.com/videos/MEDIAID-sourcekey.mp4&quot;,
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>Here, "<strong>file</strong>" is required. You can find the content URL in the dashboard under Content &gt; Content Detail &gt; Sources Tab, or via the <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/videos/list.html">API</a>.</p>

<h2>JW Player (Cloud) + Externally-Hosted Content</h2>
<p>When using the JW Player Cloud Player with externally-hosted content, you can embed via the <a href="#2-single-line">single-line embed</a> or via a more <a href="#2-custom">custom setup</a>. </p>
<div class="panel"><strong>Important note:</strong> When using externally-hosted content, content URLs must be added to and embedded from JW Platform in order to access JW Platform services (including <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2142460-using-jw-player-analytics">analytics</a>) for that content. This can be done via the <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1469776#adding-content">dashboard</a> or the <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/videos/create.html">API</a>.</div>

Adding the Cloud Player Library URL to your site's &lt;head&gt; gives your entire website a JW Player to use with default settings that can be overriden within specific embeds. </p>
<p>The player library URL looks like this:</p>

<p>Once the Cloud Player Library is placed in your website's &lt;head&gt; code, you'll need an embed block in-place on the page where you'd like your player to appear with your piece of content.</p> 
<p>After you add your content reference to JW Player using the <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1469776#adding-content">dashboard</a> or the <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/videos/create.html">API</a>, you'll find the JW Platform content URL in the dashboard under Content &gt; Content Detail &gt; Sources Tab, or via the <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/videos/list.html">API</a>.</p>
<p>Below is an example of the embed block, using a JW Platform URL:</p>
<div style="padding-left:20px; border-left:2px solid #aab4c8; margin:0px 0px 25px 5px;">
<pre>&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p><em>"<strong>File</strong>" is required.</em> </p>
</div>

<p>If you'd prefer to use a different URL, you can still access JW Platform services (like <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2142460-using-jw-player-analytics">analytics</a>) by making sure your embed contains the <strong>mediaid</strong> parameter associated with the piece of content you <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1469776#adding-content">added</a> to JW Platform.</p>

<p>Below is an example of the embed block, using a non-JW-Platform URL with a JW Platform Media ID reference:</p>
<div style="padding-left:20px; border-left:2px solid #aab4c8; margin:0px 0px 25px 5px;">
<pre>&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    mediaid: &quot;MEDIAID&quot;,

});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p><em>"<strong>File</strong>" is required. You will replace MEDIAID with the JW Platform Media ID for your piece of content.</em> </p>
</div>


<p>In this embed block, in the &lt;body&gt; of your page, you can set overrides on any of the configuration settings that may or may not already be in the Cloud Player Library URL in the &lt;head&gt; of your site.</p>

<p>If you'd prefer to use a different URL, you can still access JW Platform services (like <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2142460-using-jw-player-analytics">analytics</a>) by making sure your embed contains the <strong>mediaid</strong> parameter associated with the piece of content you <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1469776#adding-content">added</a> to JW Platform.</p>

<p>Below is an example of the embed block, using a non-JW-Platform URL with a JW Platform Media ID reference:</p>
<div style="padding-left:20px; border-left:2px solid #aab4c8; margin:0px 0px 25px 5px;">
<pre>&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/JavaScript&quot;&gt;
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
    file: &quot;//example.com/uploads/myVideo.mp4&quot;,
    mediaid: &quot;MEDIAID&quot;,

});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p><em>"<strong>File</strong>" is required. You will replace MEDIAID with the JW Platform Media ID for your piece of content.</em> </p>
</div>


<p>In this embed block, in the &lt;body&gt; of your page, you can set overrides on any of the configuration settings that may or may not already be in the Cloud Player Library URL in the &lt;head&gt; of your site.</p>
