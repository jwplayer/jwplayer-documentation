<div class="article_callout">The JW Player product &amp; engineering teams have been hard at work preparing a brand new Analytics experience for our publishers. When we started this project, we reached out to our users and got some amazing feedback about what could be better. And we heard you! So finally, over the next few months, we are rolling out some exciting improvements.</div>

<p>The first step to building out our new Analytics product was to <strong>strengthen our publishers&rsquo; data</strong>. We built a process by which any content registered in our system (via the dashboard or the API) is automatically assigned a unique <strong>Media ID</strong> (which is then included in the dashboard-provided embed code). Current Platform customers will be familiar with the concept &mdash; Media ID is just another name for Video Key.<br />

<h2>What Do I Need to Know?</h2>

<div style="padding: 30px; border:2px solid #128DEB; border-radius:4px;">
<p><strong>As of October, your analytics dashboard will switch over, and will only display data associated with valid Media IDs. </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Any data (even historical data) NOT associated with a valid Media ID will NOT be captured or displayed at this point. </em></li>
	<li><em>You will see backfilled data back to the time you begin using Media IDs &mdash; OR, if you were already using Media IDs, only back to August 1st. </em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you know that you will need access to data from before August 1st (or from before you began using Media IDs), you have <em>until the switch happens</em> to export that data. </strong></p>
</div>

<h2><span>Why the Switch?</span></h2>-->

<p>Using Media IDs allows us to accurately attribute all data points to a corresponding piece of content. One improvement in particular: Metrics from stolen player keys will no longer pollute Content and Audience Analytics data.</p>

<p>Plus, Media IDs set a powerful foundation for the other Analytics products and features we&rsquo;ll release at the same time, like true video-level metrics.</p>
&nbsp;

<h2><span>Who Will Be Affected?</span></h2>

<p><strong>If you already use our dashboard to add content and generate embed code</strong>, no action needs to be taken. After the switch, you will only see backfilled data from August 1st &mdash; you may want to export your data prior to the October switch.</p>

<p><strong>If you self-host, or use other methods of embedding content in your players</strong>, and want to have access to future Analytics product releases, please make sure that all of your pieces of content have a valid, JW Player-generated, Media ID by following the steps below.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply-media-IDs"><span>How to Apply Media IDs </span></h2>

<p><em>Note: If you already use the dashboard to add content and generate embed code, your setup work is already done.</em></p>

<ol>
	<li>Get Media IDs for your content via the <strong>Dashboard</strong> or the <strong>API </strong>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Dashboard:</strong> Add externally-hosted URLs or upload your content via the dashboard, and find the Media ID on each piece of content&rsquo;s detail page

		<ul>
			<li>Go to your Content section, and select &ldquo;upload&rdquo; or &ldquo;add via URL&rdquo; on the big action button on the top left</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>API:</strong> The <a href="http://apidocs.jwplayer.com/methods/videos/create.html" target="_blank">/videos/create method</a> supports externally-hosted URLs
		<ul>
			<li>Be sure to define <strong>sourcetype</strong> as &#39;url&#39; and to also include your <strong>sourceurl</strong></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<br />
	<li>From now on, embed all NEW content using Media IDs
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Dashboard:</strong> Once your content is added, click &ldquo;embed&rdquo; on a video from the detail page or list page. (Publish Mode generates single-line embed codes that contain a reference to your content&rsquo;s Media ID.)</li>
		<li><strong>API:</strong> Include the Media ID parameter in your player embeds, as in the below code example
		<pre>
playlist:[{
file:&quot;&quot;,
mediaid:&quot;eXaMPlE1&quot;
}]</pre>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<br />
	<li>
	<p>To ensure analytics are returned for EXISTING content embeds:</p>

	<p>This will make sure that after the switch you will see backfilled data from the time you added Media IDs to these embeds.</p>

	<ol type="A">
		<li>Replace those embeds with dashboard (single-line) embed code, or</li>
		<li>Make sure you add the above Media ID parameter into each of your existing embeds.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2><span>Test it Out</span></h2>

<p>If you believe your Media IDs have been set up correctly, use <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/analytics/beta" target="_blank">this test page</a> to see if your Media ID data is coming through. <em>(Note: this test page is only available to users of our new, JW7 dashboard)</em>.</p>

<h2>Quick FAQs</h2>

<h3>I already use Media IDs on my content. What should I do to prepare for the October switch?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>If you require access to data from before August 1st (the date to which we will backfill data after the switch in October), you&rsquo;ll want to export your data via dashboard CSV download or other methods. (This option is available in both the older dashboard as well as the new, JW7 dashboard).</li>
	<li>Otherwise &mdash; you are already set up, and no further action is needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What is a Media ID?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A Media ID is an 8-character, alphanumeric string that is tied to one specific media object (like a video file). This ID is generated by our platform to differentiate between unique media objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How do I make sure my content is associated with valid Media IDs?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>If you already use the dashboard to publish, no extra work is required.</li>
	<li>If you publish using other methods, follow the instructions in &ldquo;<a href="#how-to-apply-media-IDs">How to Apply Media IDs</a>,&rdquo; above.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Why is a valid Media ID now required for Analytics?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>JW Player is releasing a few brand-new data &amp; analytics products. Switching to Media-ID-filtered analytics was the first step to making sure these products provide you with valuable and actionable data.</li>
</ul>
