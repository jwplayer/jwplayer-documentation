The JW Player SDK for iOS (JW Player SDK) is built upon the native iOS player framework, AVFoundation. This allows you to create a custom video experience that accesses the speed and performance of the native OS in conjunction with JW Player features.

- Customize the player to match your in-app branding
- Configure player behaviors to support your app experience
- Add curated playlists
- Stream encrypted live feeds
- Incorporate advertising

Apps built with the JW Player SDK integrate with video hosting, streaming, and analytics services. These services allow you to incorporate a video experience, monetize your app, and discover ways to increase viewer engagement. You can also use the JW Player SDK with video content that is hosted with non-JW Player services.
